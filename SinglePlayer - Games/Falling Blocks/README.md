# Falling Blocks Game

A simple falling blocks game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the falling blocks game up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run the game, you need a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/falling-blocks-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd falling-blocks-game
   ```

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to control a falling block and prevent it from reaching the bottom of the game container. The block falls continuously from the top of the container, and your task is to move the block left or right to avoid obstacles and keep it from touching the bottom.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the block horizontally. The block will wrap around to the opposite side when reaching the edge of the container.
